# Pilot study: Global weather and changes in vertebrate abundance

---

Pilot study on terrestrial mammals to investigate how weather influences annual changes in abundance.

Here we are making use of:

1. The Living Planet Index database of annual vertebrate abundances, which can be found at https://livingplanetindex.org/home/index.
2. The CHELSA Climatologies at high resolution for the earthâ€™s land surface areas, which is from [Karger et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017122).

The analysis is split into the following sections:

1. Extracting data from CHELSA for the localities of the living planet index studies.
2. Exploring both the CHELSA data and the Living Planet Index data.
3. Exploring a range of local weather variables from the CHELSA data.
4. Detrending annual abundance data to focus on annual changes excluding underlying trends.
